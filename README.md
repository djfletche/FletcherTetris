# Fletcher Tetris

I made this project in intellij. I took a lot of time and went through a lot of erros trying to make this project work

## Getting Started
you only need to run the program for it to work
the html is very basic and the javascript handles most of the work.

### future development
I want to up date the scoreboard and get more creative with that.
the original idea was for the program to run with a AI


```
```

## The Website
set everything up in your editor as it is branched in the repository and you should be fine.

## Built With

I Used a lot of resorces and went to a lot of different websites to debug my issues. 
at the end of the project i was able to solve all of my issues.
